**Google Powered Assistant Guide**

**Which Model**

This is what the interface said when I asked about the model.

I'm using Gemini 2.0 Flash, part of the family of AI models from Google. It allows me to deliver faster responses and stronger performance across a number of key benchmarks for everyday help with tasks like brainstorming, learning, and writing. You can also talk to me about something serious or just have a fun conversation. Whatever is on your mind, I'm here for you.
